# SavvorBackEnd

This is the backbone of the project, savvor.

This backend will connects to the database that holds the data for the Savvor project.

# Purpose

supermarket is full of surprise, there is always something you have never tried before.
You want to be a little adventurous today and put this unfamaliar package of edible in to your shopping cart,
but at the same time you are also worried: 

"What if I don't like it?"

That's right, we have all been there. That opened package of food you don't know what to do with.

You are not fansy about the idea of shoving it down to your throat,
it's taking up space in your shelfs but throwing it away seems like a huge waste of food... 
and giving it away feels awkward too, because you don't really want to treat your friends like some sort of recycle bin.

And then you wished: "If only I haven't bought it in first place!"

But how could you know? The image looked pretty and the description seemed delectable! 
If only you can sample it beforehand! Sadly, supermarket can't have sample booth for every product they sell.

Here is when Savvor comes to rescue!

Looked up the food item in question and see what others says about it. Maybe you expected this chicken nugget has only a hint of spiceness, but it is actually buffalo spicy! You still don't get to taste it before you boy(I wish you can), but now you have a better understanding on what you are buying!


Savvor aims to be a community for everyone to politely discuss about food products. We encourage Savvors to describe detail of products objectively so others would be able to make better decision of making food purchase.
